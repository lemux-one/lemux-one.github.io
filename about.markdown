I am a software engineer/developer with a solid background in full stack web development. I've been able to participate in the creation of quite different software solutions in my career, from intranets to GIS applications, including (but not limited to) institutional blogs, webapps for small enterprise management and a couple of desktop oriented systems.

I learned the basics of software development using Java as my main programming language and PHP for my first websites. Found myself using Python years later and I am very passionate about it for its simplicity and its batteries included approach. Django, Spring Boot and Vue are my favorite frameworks to work with and PostgreSQL is my DBMS of choice most of the time with SQLite for simplicity if the task allows me to use it.

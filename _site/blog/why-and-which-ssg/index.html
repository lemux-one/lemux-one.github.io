<h2>Available alternatives</h2>
<p>
    Creating websites is a lot more easy today than it was a few years ago. There a lot of hosting providers ready to
    fullfill every posible need for a regular website. They are also quite affordable. However I had my eye put on a
    very particular service: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. This is not a sorprise taking into
    account that I am a software developer who deals with GitHub from time to time, so it made perfect sense to make use
    of this great service they opened to the public and so many people are happily using ever since. But, this decision
    had very specific implications.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> says so</h2>
<p>
    Regular web hosting platfomrs are great but I wanted to try out <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
    for once and that forced me to look at some "serverless" alternatives. Of course that <a
        href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> proposes a really good and solid option named <a
        href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but reading the installation and getting started guides I had the sense
    that it was way too involved and quirky. Also setting up a whole <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>
    stack on my device just to create a dead simple blog was too much for me. There has to be a simpler alternative,
    right?
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="https://jamstack.org/">"Jamstack"</a> has been growing rapidly in the last few years and I've been
    intrigued and curious about it for quite a bit. The speed boost obtained by not depending on a server processing at
    all is quite interesting but, in my opinion, the killer feature about this web development approach is the free (or
    almost free) of charge "hosting" availability from <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a> networks to <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> buckets. This kind of sites can be deployed virtually anywhere with
    little to no effort at all.
</p>

<h2>So many choices</h2>
<p>
    So far so good. However there are currently a lot of options to choose from when we opt for a static site generator
    (SSG) and they all seem very capable and feature rich since we start reading their "getting starter" guides. The
    first one I stumbled on was <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. This "little" guy grows with new features by day
    and right now it looks like a swif knive, ranging from small single page sites to batteries-included blogs. From
    there on I felt overwhelmed and started looking for simpler alternatives for my really basic needs.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite">maksite.py</a> to the rescue</h2>
<p>
    After searching, reading, trying, messing around and get frustrated with several SSG options I stumbled with <a
        href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite">maksite.py</a> and it made sense since the very begging. It was
    tiny. It was simple. It was easy to look into its inner workings to tweak any part of it. It provided the bare bones
    to be considered a SSG but it was all I actually needed. Indeed it had more than I required for my project and I
    just forked it and remove the bloat and it was a breeze to do so. That little guy feels like a great tool and I am
    very happy with it so far.

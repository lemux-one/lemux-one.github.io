  <h2>... me!</h2>

  <p>
    I am a software engineer/developer with a solid background in full stack web
    development. I've been able to participate in the creation of quite
    different software solutions in my career, from intranets to GIS
    applications, including (but not limited to) institutional blogs, webapps
    for small enterprise management and a couple of desktop oriented systems.
  </p>

  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>
      I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
    </li>
    {
      identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
        <li>
          Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}
        </li>
      )
    }
  </ul>
  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>

  {happy && <p>I am happy to be a forever learner!</p>}

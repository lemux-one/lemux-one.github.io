# Introduction

[Imba](https://imba.io/) is a fascinating programming language that combines the elegance of Ruby's syntax with powerful built-in features for web development. Created in 2014 by Sindre Aarsaether, it was designed to make web application development more intuitive and performant. While it may not be as widely known as other frameworks, Imba's innovative approach to UI development and seamless JavaScript interoperability makes it worth exploring.

What sets Imba apart is its unique compilation strategy - instead of using a virtual DOM like React, it compiles directly to efficient DOM operations. This approach, combined with its terse yet readable syntax, allows developers to write less code while achieving better runtime performance.

In this article, we'll dive into what makes Imba special, explore its key features, and discuss whether it might be the right choice for your next web project..

# Selling points

Imba offers several standout features that make it an intriguing choice for web development:

### **Ruby-like Syntax**

Imba's syntax takes inspiration from Ruby, emphasizing readability and elegance. This results in clean, expressive code that minimizes boilerplate. Developers coming from Ruby or other human-readable languages will find the transition to Imba particularly intuitive.

### **Built-in UI-Oriented Features**

Unlike many frameworks and libraries that require additional tools or plugins for UI development, Imba comes equipped with powerful, built-in features:

- **Styles:** Inline and scoped styling are seamlessly integrated, removing the need for external CSS files or preprocessors. It is heavily inspired by TailwindCSS but attempting to be even more concise and composable.
- **Events:** Imba provides a simple, declarative syntax for handling events, reducing the complexity of adding interactivity. It also uses the concept of “event modifiers” to effectively chain helper wrappers with dot notation.
- **Templates:** Its template system blends logic and structure cleanly, eliminating the verbosity commonly found in JSX or similar template engines. Not a huge improvement but still worthy to mention.
- **No Virtual DOM:** By skipping the Virtual DOM entirely, Imba directly compiles to optimized DOM operations, leading to faster runtime performance and less overhead. Which sounds great but there is a debate online about it since some people argue against Imba’s approach.

### **Seamless JavaScript Interoperability**

Imba is designed to work hand-in-hand with JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with existing libraries, frameworks, and APIs. Whether you're integrating a third-party JavaScript library or building a full-stack application, Imba’s interop capabilities make the process smooth and straightforward.

# Compared to popular alternatives

Let's explore how Imba's approach differs from popular frameworks:

- React
  - While React relies on a Virtual DOM for updates, Imba compiles directly to DOM operations
  - Imba's component syntax is more concise than JSX
- Svelte
  - Both compile to vanilla JavaScript, but Imba includes more built-in features
  - Imba's styling system is integrated into the language, unlike Svelte's scoped CSS
- Elm
  - Elm offers stronger type safety but requires learning a purely functional paradigm
  - Imba provides easier JavaScript interop while maintaining good performance

Each framework has its strengths, but Imba's unique combination of Ruby-like syntax and direct DOM compilation sets it apart in terms of developer experience and performance.

# Developer experience

The developer experience in Imba is well thought out, with several tools and features that make coding more enjoyable:

- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) playground/platform (which is made in Imba itself from top to bottom)
  - Interactive tutorials and playgrounds available
  - Learn by doing with live code examples
- IDE Support
  - Good Visual Studio Code integration
  - Syntax highlighting and autocompletion available
- Development Workflow
  - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for quick feedback
  - Fast compilation times for better productivity

# Is it worthy

While Imba remains relatively unpopular in the broader web development landscape and suffers from limited documentation compared to mainstream frameworks, it brings several noteworthy innovations to the table.

The language's unique approach to UI development, direct DOM compilation, and integrated styling system demonstrate fresh thinking in web framework design. These interesting concepts can broaden a developer's perspective on what's possible in web development, even if they ultimately choose a different tool for their projects.

Whether or not you adopt Imba for production use, studying its architecture and design choices can be a mind-opening experience that influences how you think about web development and framework design. Its innovative features and performance-focused approach may well influence the next generation of web frameworks.
